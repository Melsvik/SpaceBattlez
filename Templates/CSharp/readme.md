BasicBot.cs is where the bot logic should be placed.
Feel free to rename the file and the class.
Just be sure that Program.cs don't try to create an instance of BasicBot if you have renamed the class.

To compile the Bot run the following command: "dotnet publish -c release -r linux-x64"
then navigate to the folder: "bin\release\netcoreapp2.1\linux-x64\"
Select the files called BotName*

For BasicBot it will be:
- BasicBot
- BasicBot.dll
- BasicBot.pdb
- BasicBot.deps.json
- BasicBot.runtimeconfig.json
- BasicBot.runtimeconfig.dev.json

Zip the files and call the zip file the same as the Bot, in this case BasicBot.zip.
Upload the zip to www.spacebattlez.com
